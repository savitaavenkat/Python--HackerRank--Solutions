# Problem statement:
# ------------------
#A bracket is considered to be any one of the following characters: (, ), {, }, [, or ].
#Two brackets are considered to be a matched pair if the an opening bracket (i.e., (, [, or {) occurs to the left of a closing bracket (i.e., ), ], or }) of the exact same type. There are three types of matched pairs of brackets: [], {}, and ().
#A matching pair of brackets is not balanced if the set of brackets it encloses are not matched. For example, {[(])} is not balanced because the contents in between { and } are not balanced. The pair of square brackets encloses a single, unbalanced opening bracket, (, and the pair of parentheses encloses a single, unbalanced closing square bracket, ].
#By this logic, we say a sequence of brackets is balanced if the following conditions are met:
#It contains no unmatched brackets.
#The subset of brackets enclosed within the confines of a matched pair of brackets is also a matched pair of brackets.
#Given  strings of brackets, determine whether each sequence of brackets is balanced. If a string is balanced, return YES. Otherwise, return NO.

# Function Description:
# ---------------------
#Complete the function isBalanced in the editor below. It must return a string: YES if the sequence is balanced or NO if it is not.
#isBalanced has the following parameter(s):
#s: a string of bracket

# Input Format:
# -------------
#The first line contains a single integer , the number of strings.
#Each of the next  lines contains a single string , a sequence of brackets.

# Constraints:
# ------------
#All chracters in the sequences âˆˆ { {, }, (, ), [, ] }.

# Output Format:
# --------------
#For each string, return YES or NO.


# Solution:
# ---------
